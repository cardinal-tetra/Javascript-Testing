### Brief Overview
Running the application is mainly a matter of opening the file, index.html. The functionality of the Feed Reader application can be tested by clicking on links, opening/closing the slide menu and switching to different feeds.

### Jasmine Testing
The main point of this project however is to demonstrate our mastery of JavaScript testing. To the bottom of index.html, are the results of tests run by the Jasmine testing framework. When you have first opened index.html, there may appear to be a refreshing of the page- not to worry, that is just the testing framework being carried out.

Jasmine should show all the tests being passed, but to examine more closely, open up jasmine/spec/feedreader.js which contains the code for the various specs that have been run on index.html. The code is a series of 'distribution' and 'it' calls that are sequential to the tests on index.html and project instructions. No additional tests have been added.
